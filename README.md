What my approved feature/mechanic is:

Referencing Sonic Generations, I plan to recreate the physics and momentum with running and jumping. The player holding the run button will gradually increase speed until around the top speed. 
There will be varied jump heights based on tapping or holding the jump button, the taps will act like short-hops and keep most of the momentum, while doing a full jump costs more momentum.

How you can test it in my project?:
Run around the big area and utilize the controls for the adrenaline-pumping speed!
